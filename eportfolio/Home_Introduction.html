        <p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When attending a school dedicated to STEM, it can become very easy and draining to get lost in the numbers of it all. The chemistry assignments begin to blur with the linear algebra until all that you eat, breathe, and sleep is the formulas and equations provided to you. As someone who grew up with a love for liberal arts, it made me question my purpose here. I started asking myself everyday, “Why am I here?” While I still have not found the answer to that question quite yet, I have discovered that liberal arts classes will be crucial in my time here at Georgia Tech. This English 1102 course has allowed me to explore the creativity that I have been craving and that STEM classes often lack.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon creating my introductory video to the course, I had so much excitement for the semester ahead of me. My fall semester had been bleak, and I had hoped to reinvigorate myself in the spring. As someone who had participated in theater, the idea of getting to explore any possible genre excited me. During my senior year, I had actually helped write eight total scripts for my school’s drama club, and I had missed the thrill of being a writer. When deciding on the style, I thought upon what some of my greatest interests were and chose </span><i><span>Star Trek</span></i><span> in the end since I figured it would, at the very least, be original. To create a darker, moodier lighting, I enlisted the help of my friends' flashlights and lamps in an attempt to add the same strange spotlights found on William Shatner. All seemed well until I reached the editing process. While I had some experience with editing, it was no where near the vision I had for the final product. In the end, after hours of splicing audios, I came to a product I could at least be somewhat proud of.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The first major project provided me with a greater chance to connect with my past theatrical experiences. While I did briefly consider doing a short story instead, I knew ultimately that the monologue would be my final choice. I had done a countless number of monologues in my high school years. While I had tried to run from my theatre kid past, it is a crucial part of me and is something to just embrace. When deciding upon which story to tell, I decided that telling a story I have shared with many others before would probably be best. Since I have told the story so many times, I figured it already had a bit of a rhythm to it that would aid me. When the recording process came, I had a ridiculous number of outtakes. Through this, I discovered that consciously telling a story, where you consider the words spoken instead of instinctually moving through it, creates a greater sense of nervousness. While I have told monologues before, those were always someone else's story. The feeling of having my own story told took some getting used to.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The second major project had been something I had worried about from the start of the class. As soon as I had heard about the idea of creating a music video, I was already on edge. One would think that I would not mind being filmed given that I was in theatre, but the stage does not have the permanence of a camera. Early on in the project, I had confused a date that our group had decided on to meet. I had a very bad day and drove home because I needed to be off campus. I was very surprised to see a notification on my phone from Adelai asking about where I was, and I panicked shortly after when I realized my mistake. This set the tone of the rest of the project for me because, moving forward, I wanted nothing more than to prove that I was not just going to be the dead weight in our group.&nbsp; This actually resulted in me putting forward nearly too much work. In the end, while I had missed a class or two, I was the only one that was present at each filming shoot and I completed nearly all of the editing myself. While I do not regret the work that I put into the project, I very quickly learned after editing to not overcriticize myself over the same errors that others often make.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The final major project came at a low point in my personal life, and I fear that that was reflected into the final product. When beginning the project, I decided to choose something that would actually comfort me. James Gunn's <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> is one of my comfort movies, so I jumped at the opportunity to watch it again since I needed some comfort of my own. As I went through the movie once more, I wrote notes on each song that appeared (shown in Fig. 1). While I recognized that his grief for his mother was a defining trait of his, I did not identify the mixtape as a frame until I was halfway through the movie.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Fig. 1: Sample Notes from Watching&nbsp;<em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em></em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ultimately, my time and effort put into this class has helped to remind me of why I have had a greater preference for the arts and humanities. Despite science's ability to explain how we exist, I have always found the reasons for <em>why </em>we exist to be much more interesting. More than anything else, I hope to use the editing skills I have had to learn in order to continue telling stories in ways I had not previously been able to.</span></p>
